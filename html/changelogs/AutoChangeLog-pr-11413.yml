changes:
  - rscadd: Concussive gauntlets have arrived! Shaft miners will find that the diamond
      pickaxe can no longer be found in tendril chests, and instead they may find
      concussive gauntlets!
  - tweak: Tumor shards will now poll ghosts for control of lavaland elites if the
      original player has left the body. There is still no guarantee of having a new
      pet if alternatives are not available.
  - tweak: Gibtonite fuses are no longer variable so that miners with good timing
      are more consistently rewarded for risking life and limb to try and defuse it.
  - balance: PKA modkits have been standardized to cost either 0%, 25%, or 50% capacity.
      This means it is now possible to utilize 100% of the weapon's potential and
      up to four impactful mods may now be installed!
  - balance: PKA modkits that do AoE damage have had their power doubled, but still
      have an upper limit of 80% normal power. It is now far more practical to install
      AoE damage mods, but will still weaken the power of the weapon overall in exchange
      for versatility.
  - balance: Damage increasing modkits have had their power halved. This was overlooked
      during the major lavaland rebalance that halved the HP of all fauna and halved
      the damage of mining tools. Damage modkits are supposed to increase damage by
      25% of base power, not 50%.
  - tweak: All modkits are now compatible with mine bots, and the special cooldown
      reduction mod has been removed since the normal cooldown mod works on them now.
      Mine bots have the same capacity for mods as a PKA.
  - tweak: 'Explorer webbing can now hold additional mining tools and items: shovel,
      survival knife, emergency oxygen tank, PKA and plasma cutters. It can no longer
      hold kitchen knives.'
  - code_imp: Cleaned up some variable names and unnecessary code within the kinetic_accelerator
      file.
