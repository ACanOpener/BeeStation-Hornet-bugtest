changes:
  - tweak: Players are no longer limited to a single positronic brain per round.
  - tweak: Cyborgs may no longer have duplicate names, unless they are being rebuilt
      from the same brain that was previously a cyborg - if you are respawning as
      a fresh cyborg and do not choose a different character profile first, you will
      be given the default cyborg name instead of becoming a second copy of the same
      cyborg.
