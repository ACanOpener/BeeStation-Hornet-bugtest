changes:
  - rscdel: Door charges have been entirely removed from the game code
  - tweak: Instead, any grenade can now be inserted into an open airlock, which will
      cause it to detonate the next time the airlock opens. This is how door charges
      behaved.
  - rscdel: Large chemical grenades have been removed. These were able to hold bluespace
      beakers and slime cores.
  - tweak: All chemical grenades accept xenobio slime cores now.
  - tweak: Chemical payloads no longer require Gibtonite or C4, a simple igniter will
      do now.
  - tweak: Primed grenades will now have a +/- 40% variable fuse timer to reinforce
      their purpose as area denial tools moreso than sudden takedown tools. Cook grenades
      at your peril.
  - bugfix: You will no longer attempt to place C4/X4 that is no longer in your hands
      because you've already done something else with it. This means no more accidentally
      bombing your bag of explosives.
