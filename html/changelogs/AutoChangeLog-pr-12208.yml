changes:
  - bugfix: Lazarus injectors will now work as originally intended on non-sentient
      mobs. This means that lazarus revived mobs will be passive to crew and other
      passive mobs, friendly toward the person that revived them, and actively hostile
      to other hostile mobs.
  - tweak: Lazarus injectors will continue to work as they always have on already
      sentient mobs, and the intent is now clearly stated in-game to those mobs when
      they are revived. Lazarus is not a brainwashing tool and does not force loyalty
      or obedience in the creatures it revives if they are smart enough to think for
      themselves
  - tweak: Lazarus injectors now have a 10% chance of making any mob revived by one
      sentient, with its own free will to choose violence, servitude or anything in
      between.
  - tweak: The examine text of lazarus injectors now includes a warning that creatures
      with "especially strong wills" are known to turn against the user. This is in
      reference to both already sentient mobs and the newly added chance to create
      a sentient mob.
  - tweak: Lazarus now takes ten seconds to take effect, with the mob it is used on
      jittering a bit before actually being revived.
