changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed undocumented changes to revenants. They can now phase shift and
      teleport again, and their malfunction ability properly triggers EMPs again.
      Runechat displays when using telepathy again
  - tweak: Revenants can now teleport to specific locations on the station instead
      of just back to the station from off of the station. This ability may be used
      even if they are already on the station
  - tweak: Malfunction now affects APCs and SMES, and when successfully emagging an
      object it will show purple sparkles.
  - tweak: Revenant telepathy works even if the person it's being used on has protection
      from other revenant magic
