  - bugfix: bodybag, rollerbed, deployable bot can be placed onto a turf you're on
  - tweak: if a deployable item can not be placed onto a turf you're on, it will notify
      you that you need to click an open area.
  - tweak: meteor shield sat is now a deployable item. This will make preparing and
      installing meteor shield sat less tedious than before.

      7 capsules. Now costs 7,000 credits.
