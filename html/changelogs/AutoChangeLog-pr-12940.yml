changes:
  - balance: Antagonist and heavy armours will now block piercing syringes.
  - balance: Any clothing that has at least 10 bullet or melee armour will block standard
      syringes and injections.
  - bugfix: Fixes multiple incorrect uses of can_inject which would have caused syringe
      guns not to function
