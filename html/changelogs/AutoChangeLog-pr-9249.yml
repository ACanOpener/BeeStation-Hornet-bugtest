changes:
  - admin: Modified the Play Internet Sound Verb so it now displays extra info about
      any song being actively played as well as showing the link
  - rscadd: added the ability to make up to 10 individual highlights in tgchat, customise
      their colours, and toggle if they highlight the whole message or not. Ported
      from CM and /tg/.
  - rscadd: you can now use regex for text highlighting. The syntax is /[regex expression]/,
      eg /dog[0-9]/. There are no quantifiers, but you can use capture groups. The
      regex must read a minimum of two characters.
