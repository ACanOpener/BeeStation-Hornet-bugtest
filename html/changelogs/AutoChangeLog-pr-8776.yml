changes:
  - refactor: Rewrote the entire preferences UI.
  - refactor: Rewrote the entire preferences backend and serialization system to reduce
      database usage, datumized the addition of preferences.
  - server: Flattened some preference database schema stuff, migration is required.
  - tweak: Loadouts now preview the items you equip on your mob, and will replace
      existing items in the preview window to ensure they preview correctly.
  - bugfix: Deadminned admins now retain their access to Donator loadout items.
  - rscadd: You can now purchase multiple antag tokens from loadouts.
  - rscadd: You can now bind up to 3 keybinds to one overall action.
  - rscadd: You can now select specific preferences to be randomized on join rather
      than globally randomizing your body. You can also make specific preferences
      only randomize if you are an antagonist.
  - tweak: PDA Theme can now be customized per-character.
  - tweak: Failed job selection now defaults to "Return to lobby" instead of "Be random
      job"
  - tweak: TGUI Dropdowns now have improved UX experience, and exist outside of the
      object they are within, instead existing above other UI elements. This means
      they cannot cause windows to scroll by overflowing, for example.
  - tweak: You can now select preferences to be randomized only when you are an antagonist
  - tweak: Per-character antagonist preferences can now be toggled globally, with
      per-character prefs only affecting if it's set to off.
