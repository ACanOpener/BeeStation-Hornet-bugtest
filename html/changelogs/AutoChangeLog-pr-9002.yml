changes:
  - tweak: High-impact roundstart dynamic rulesets are weighted less if they've been
      chosen in a recent round.
  - tweak: Normally blocked rulesets can now occur if the ruleset blocking them is
      "dead". For example, this means heretics could show up after you deconvert the
      entire cult, or traitors could appear after flukies all blow themselves up.
  - tweak: Some midround/latejoin dynamic rulesets will not roll if the station has
      been heavily damaged.
  - tweak: Roundstart rulesets (and obsessed) in dynamic now actually use antag rep.
