changes:
  - rscadd: chat-light-theme.scss, chat-dark-theme.scss. These are preferable more
      than goon folder chat scss files.
  - code_imp: BB implant chat colour and carp wavespeak char color are now more reliably
      darker/lighter based on your current background theme. If you use a light theme,
      these will be darker, and vice versa for vice versa.
