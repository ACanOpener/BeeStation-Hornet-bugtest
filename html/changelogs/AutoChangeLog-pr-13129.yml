      interaction that stops a virus or host holding a virus from spreading it to
      others.
  - rscdel: Necropolis seed symptom and bowl of blood that was supposed to be its
      source removed from the game
  - rscdel: Virus extrapolators have been removed from all maps
  - code_imp: Virus extrapolator code has been significantly trimmed. The only code
      that remains is what is necessary for medical scanners to function, to be further
      trimmed at some point in the future probably. maybe.
