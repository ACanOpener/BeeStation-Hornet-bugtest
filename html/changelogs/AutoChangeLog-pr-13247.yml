changes:
  - rscadd: Added the "Vote" verb the OOC tab, here you can check the status of current
      voting or call them if you are able.
  - tweak: Map votes now use a tally system instead of weighted RNG. What this means
      is that votes for the maps that did not win will carry over to the next map
      vote, and when that map eventually wins its tallies will be reset.
  - refactor: refactored the voting subsystem
  - tweak: Slightly altered the Emergency Shuttle undocking announcement
