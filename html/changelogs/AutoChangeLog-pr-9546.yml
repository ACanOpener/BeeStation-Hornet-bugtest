changes:
  - bugfix: Staffed department lighting will now properly be completely switched on
      at roundstart.
  - tweak: Lighting of ALL areas accessible by roundstart crewmembers (taking into
      account minimal or skeleton crew access) will be switched on at roundstart.
  - tweak: The bar and cafeteria now have their lights always switched on at roundstart,
      due to the fact they often serve as public crew gathering places, even if there
      is no bartender/chef tending to them.
  - spellcheck: Fixed a couple of typos in some area names.
