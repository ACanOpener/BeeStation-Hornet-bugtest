changes:
  - tweak: Shadow sect obelisks have less intense lighting effects
  - tweak: Various other aspects of the shadow sect have been improved on the backend
      with minimal front-end changes.
  - tweak: Shadow sect favor is earned at a steady rate per obelisk, with a bonus
      depending on how many grand rituals are completed - it will no longer compound
      with the current darkness as this made the snowballing effect too strong.
  - bugfix: The server should no longer shit itself during the third grand ritual
      of the shadow sect
  - bugfix: Night vision and extra healing from shadow obelisks no longer work through
      walls
