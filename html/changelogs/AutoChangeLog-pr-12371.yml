changes:
  - balance: EMPs are now significantly less lethal to players with cybernetic implants,
      organs and limbs including IPCs. Most cybernetics have a maximum of a 30% chance
      to be affected by an EMP now, but it will be rolled separately for each limb/organ/implant
      so that the more you have the more likely you are to be affected in some way.
      This means IPCs will still be relatively weak to EMP, but crew can upgrade in
      moderation without fear of an EMP hitting them too hard.
  - balance: Ion rifles and carbines have lost their AoE effect on the projectiles
      and now require a direct hit to trigger an EMP
  - tweak: Ion rifles have had their firing rate reduced from 2.5 shots per second
      to 1.5 shots per second
  - tweak: Ion rifles have had their capacity increased from 10 shots with a full
      charge to 15
  - tweak: Ion carbines are now fully automatic at 2.5 shots per second (this is the
      same fire rate they already had)
  - tweak: Ion carbines have a new capacity of 24, up from 10
  - tweak: Ion carbines no longer fit into bags
