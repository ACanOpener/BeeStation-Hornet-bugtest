      ANY head of staff, even non-living heart targets, if they haven't met that goal
      already.
  - tweak: Ghouls and voiceless dead now count towards the "summon X monsters from
      the Mansus" objective for flesh heretics.
  - tweak: Heretic sacrifice now grabs the ghost of the victim during revival.
  - tweak: Heretic living heart tracking now specifies if the target is catatonic
      or currently on a moving shuttle.
  - tweak: If a heretic's sacrifice target enters cryo, it will try to roll a new
      sacrifice target for them.
  - bugfix: Fixed text formatting when tracking dead living heart targets.
