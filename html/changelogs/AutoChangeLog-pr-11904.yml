changes:
  - balance: Cluwnes can now be fixed using DNA nullifiers or genetics consoles (mutadone
      won't work). This will also get rid of their cursed cluwne clothing, although
      you will still need to fix the brain damage caused by the mutation. A variant
      with the old behavior that prevents normal removal is still available for admin
      (ab)use.
  - tweak: Cluwne clothes now drop when cured.
