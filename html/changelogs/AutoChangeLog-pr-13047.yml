changes:
  - balance: The sleepy pen is now refillable, renamed to the paralytic pen.
  - balance: The default mix of the sleepy pen now paralyses a victim and allows them
      to whisper, but keeps them conscious during their bad time ahead.
  - balance: Adds whisper toxin as a precursor to mute toxin, it allows a victim to
      whisper but prevents radio use.
  - balance: Buffs stamina toxin, it now causes instant slowdown and deals double
      the stamina damage per tick.
