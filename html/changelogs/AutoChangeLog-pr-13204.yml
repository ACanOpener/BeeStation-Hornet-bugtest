changes:
  - admin: Re-added the button to the player playtime panel that lets admins toggle
      a player's job playtime exemption status.
  - refactor: Rewrite the way we handle which roles get assigned with playtime tracking.
  - bugfix: Players who get MMI'd and put into borgs or AIs mid-shift now gain job
      playtime tracking towards Silicon roles instead.
