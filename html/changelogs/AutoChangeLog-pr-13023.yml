changes:
  - rscadd: Security cyborgs are available again, but they have a fresh coat of paint
      and a new name (Guardian) to hopefully distance them from trying to enforce
      space law. They do not require research to unlock, but are also substantially
      weaker than they used to be. They have swapped their stun batons for pepper
      clouds, and their gun now has a limited capacity that recharges from the cyborg
      cell over time. Guardian cyborgs also have additional armor plating to help
      protect them, especially from explosives that kicks in after firing their gun.
  - rscadd: Guardian cyborg guns now have two additional firing modes, taken from
      the exploration gun. These modes allow them to demolish terrain and obstacles
      as well as deal high damage to non-humanoid creatures. Both of these projectiles
      will cause only 5 damage to humanoids.
  - rscadd: Guardian cyborgs come equipped with an ore satchel and GPS in addition
      to their fancy gun in order to provide better off-station support.
  - rscadd: Guardian cyborgs have been given a hugging module and lollipop dispenser
      to help put crew at ease, appropriate for their new appearance.
  - rscadd: Standard cyborgs have gained a GPS and ore satchel as well
  - tweak: Cyborgs are no longer completely stonewalled by holosigns and may pass
      through them.
  - bugfix: Explorer gun energy overlays are now displaying, and a new overlay has
      been created for the "demolish" mode intended to destroy terrain and objects
      which is purple in color.
  - rscdel: Removes the now unused cyborg disabler upgrade from
  - rscdel: Sort of removed the borgi from the game, since the new guardian borg has
      hijacked their appearance. The sprite has also been modified by two pixels so
      that it has a more neutral expression.
