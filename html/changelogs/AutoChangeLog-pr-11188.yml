changes:
  - refactor: refactors machine and power code to cut down on processing costs
  - bugfix: fixes non-processing machines failing to consume power
  - bugfix: fixes rechargers and inducers allowing for effectively infinite power.
      Now, what is used to charge these cells is exactly what can be expended from
      them.
  - tweak: rechargers now suck power directly from surplus energy on the powergrid,
      as opposed to the Equipment part of an APC. This is to prevent the former fix
      from making every single recharger on the station a mini-energy siphon.
  - rscadd: examining any machinery will now tell if it's powered or not.
