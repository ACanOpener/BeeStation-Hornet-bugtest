changes:
  - code_imp: unconsciousness is now a trait, cleaned up its usage in mobility and
      stat, which should make it perform a lot quicker and generate less edge-cases
  - bugfix: being woken up from unconsciousness should always clear trauma-induced
      monochromatic vision
  - bugfix: moves a sleeping check in regenerative coma a few lines ahead. It's intended
      use in code that voluntarily sleeping provides less healing benefit than entering
      a coma through trauma/medicine.
  - balance: Which... now technically makes it a balance change. It was always intended,
      but using the sleep verb will now heal you less than involuntary unconciousness,
      in terms of the regen rate of the regenerative coma
