  - balance: AI tracking now requires a target to stand still for X seconds in order
      to acquire a track when used from the menu or from radio. X is calculated using
      the following formula. If the target has GPS tracking beacon, X is 0. If not
      X starts at 4. Subtract 1 second if the target is in the light. Subtract 1 second
      if the target's ID matches their name. Subtract 1 second if the target's face
      is visible and not disfigured.
  - balance: AI tracking can instantly track a target if they have sensors enabled,
      or are a robot.
