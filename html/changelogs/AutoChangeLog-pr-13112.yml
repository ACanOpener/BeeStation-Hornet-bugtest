changes:
  - rscadd: The Advanced Gas Rig, capable of mining gases from the planet the station
      is orbiting.
  - rscadd: Gas Rig Monitor program, which uses NTnet to remotely control the gas
      rig
  - rscadd: Adds a Gas Rig Shielding power value to each gas
  - tweak: Adjusted maps to fit the new gas rig.
  - tweak: Waste now is vented, rather then filtered out. The filter line is for the
      gas rig now.
  - rscdel: Removed gas miners from all maps except for echo, as the gas rig being
      there makes no sense
