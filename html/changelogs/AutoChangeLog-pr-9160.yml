changes:
  - bugfix: Blood filtering won't take forever trying to wean off the last 1 toxin
      damage in someone
  - rscadd: Holding a health analyzer in your other hand during blood filtering surgery
      will show the remaining toxin damage and reagent volume, similar to wound tending
      surgery.
  - tweak: Tweaked the surgery messages for filtering blood so that they appear properly
      to third party observers.
