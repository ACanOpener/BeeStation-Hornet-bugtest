changes:
  - rscadd: Almost completely reworked holoparasites.
  - rscadd: New holoparasite major ability, Dextrous, which allows the holoparasite
      to hold and use items, in additional to having a single internal storage slot.
      However, Dextrous holoparasites have limitations on being able to use guns or
      two-handed weapons, and they rely on weapons in order to do notable damage,
      as their punches are weak.
  - rscadd: New holoparasite minor ability, Telepathy. It's exactly what it says on
      the tin.
  - rscadd: New holoparasite minor ability, Babeltongue. It allows your holoparasite
      (only the holopara, not the summoner) to both speak and understand all languages,
      akin to a pAI with the universal translator, or the curator.
  - rscadd: New holoparasite minor ability, Radio Noise. It allows your holoparasite
      (only the holopara, not the summoner) to hear most radio channels (except Centcom
      and Syndicate).
  - rscadd: Added stat thresholds for many holoparasite abilities.
  - rscadd: "Reworked the melee/ranged system for holoparasites into a 'weapons' system,\
      \ with 3 main weapons being offered for them: Punch, Ranged, and Bladed."
  - tweak: You can now only see the name of a holoparasite whenever the summoner takes
      recoil damage if the holoparasite taking damage can actually be seen within
      range of the summoner.
  - tweak: Brute and burn damage absorbed by holoparasites now transfer 'properly'
      to the summoner, rather than all damage being transformed into brute.
  - tweak: The movement speed of holoparasites is now affected by their Speed stat.
  - rscdel: Removed requiem holoparasites. As with stand arrows, they were nigh-unobtainable
      anyways, and there was literally only one requiem ability left in the code.
