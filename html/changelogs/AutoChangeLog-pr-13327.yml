changes:
  - balance: Reduces the PDA's inactive power consumption, power consumption is now
      higher when you have programs open. PDAs never use power while turned off.
  - balance: Flashlight PDA now consumes and requires power, flickering when low on
      power.
  - balance: PDA batteries charge slightly faster.
