changes:
  - bugfix: radstation scimaint and medmaint has been split into more separate maintenance
      areas, these places were massive and non-contiguous.
  - balance: radstation armory no longer has its own backup SMES
  - balance: radstation no longer has random shock grilles for lower-security areas
      such as maintenance, tool storage, chemistry, and medbay (really?)
  - bugfix: radstation cables now prefer to pass through doors versus windows and
      machines.
