changes:
  - balance: Hand restraints such as handcuffs are now much simpler to break out of.
      Each attempt takes only five seconds and gives a miniscule chance of breaking
      out immediately if you get lucky with a compounding chance after each attempt.
      Each attempt stacks up to eventually being enough to guarantee the cuffs are
      removed once your total attempts are equal to the breakout time as well.
  - balance: Attempts to remove any types of restraint (Bola, cuffs, straight jackets,
      etc.) no longer require you to be still and motionless, which means you can
      run around like a headless chicken and still break out of some cuffs. Being
      dragged in circles by an officer no longer interrupts breakout attempts either.
  - balance: Because the general process for breaking hand restraints is now much
      more consistent, the base times for all three hand restraints has been increased
      dramatically so that handcuffs are still effective at their intended purpose,
      just without being an indefinite restraint.
  - tweak: Buckle-cuffed players are able to remove their restraints first now, so
      buckling a player who is cuffed does nothing to lengthen the effective restraint
      time further, it only prevents them from running around.
  - tweak: straight jackets take two minutes to break out of instead of five now,
      because five is an excessive amount of time to potentially stack on top of cuffs.
  - tweak: Xenomorphs can no longer instantly break cuffs. They use the same define
      and code as hulks do, taking five seconds to break the cuffs. In both hulk and
      xeno cases, the cuffs can now be broken while moving.
