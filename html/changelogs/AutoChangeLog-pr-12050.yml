changes:
  - balance: 'Completely overhauled dismemberment and weapon sharpness. Weapons now
      have four levels of sharpness: Blunt, Sharp, Dismember and Easy Dismember.'
  - balance: Blunt weapons are now only able to cause dismemberment on species that
      have the easy dismemberment trait, all of which can easily regenerate or otherwise
      slap their dismembered limb back into place.
  - balance: Species with the easy dismemberment trait (Skeletons, IPCs, Oozelings)
      have a chance equal to the damage received to lose a targetted limb as long
      as the limb was already damaged before being struck.
  - balance: Ordinary sharp weapons such as knives and surgical tools can only dismember
      a dead target.
  - balance: Large weapons such as swords, axes and chainsaws are only able to dismember
      a limb which has already been fully disabled. This means that it will take at
      least three hits with a fire axe to take someone's leg off.
  - balance: Bladed energy weapons have a chance equal to their damage to dismember
      a targetted limb regardless of how much damage it has taken, in addition to
      being guaranteed to dismember a limb that has been fully disabled by damage.
      The nightmare's light eater is the only non-energy weapon in this group right
      now.
  - balance: Mobs cannot be decapitated through the simplified mechanics while they
      are fully conscious - they must at minimum be asleep or in crit in order for
      dismemberment to apply when targetting someone's head for balance reasons.
