changes:
  - rscadd: Added a new voting system. Players will find a new button in their status
      tab for voting to end the current round which they can use at any time instead
      of needing to wait. The required percentage of players for the vote to succeed
      decays as the round goes on, and the button first becomes visible only after
      the shuttle is available.
  - tweak: Dead players can now vote to end a round
