changes:
  - balance: Revs no longer block the shuttle
  - balance: Revs no longer have a deconversion message
  - balance: Lawyers and HOPs can now deconvert people by using a space law book on
      them. If the lawyer is a revolutionary, then they will use this to convert people
      instead.
  - balance: Revs no longer have objectives to kill all the heads of staff, instead
      its a soft objective to establish a new command structure which works the same
      way but doesn't really matter if someone fucks off to space since it won't affect
      if you win or lose
  - balance: Revs no longer ends when all the heads of either side are killed
  - balance: Completely removes the midround rev ruleset cause its just stupid
