changes:
  - balance: swarmers may no longer ventcrawl, and will also spawn in a random location
      instead of at the gateway. Without ventcrawling, the event as a whole should
      be more of a stand-off and defense than a bunch of constantly scurrying roaches.
  - tweak: swarmers now have 65 HP
  - tweak: swarmer ranged attack is now half the speed of security's disablers
  - tweak: swarmer melee attacks now do 35 stamina damage
  - tweak: swarmer replication now costs 20 resources
  - tweak: swarmer traps and walls now cost 2 resources to place
  - tweak: swarmer traps now trigger in an AoE when destroyed and their visuals and
      sound effects have been updated. The AoE has a greater effect on cyborgs than
      previously as well, due to their immunity to stamina damage.
  - tweak: swarmer objective text has been slightly modified to clarify they can attack
      crew as long as they don't harm them
