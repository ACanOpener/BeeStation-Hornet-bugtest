changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed Dynamic spawning Wizard at literally any population.
  - bugfix: Fixed the roundend display not showing when something was executed as
      a 'lategame' round-ender.
  - tweak: Dynamic will now no longer trigger 'lategame' round-enders below 22 population,
      to allow rounds to come to their natural end via the shuttle vote.
  - balance: Tweaked the minimum population for some antagonists, moving most antags
      that start at 25-pop to 22-pop. This is to improve the overlap between the lategame
      injector and antagonist variety.
