changes:
  - tweak: 'Modernized the UI on (TGUIfied) a bunch of inputs (most things that had
      a white box and looked old should be cooler looking now). Notable examples include:
      the hand teleporter list, the spawn command, a lot of admin secret buttons,
      brain washing, some security consoles, blood cultist teleport runes, law consoles,
      pen rotation, slime feeding target list, comms console announcement, some ghost
      role alerts, fulton packs, choice beacon pet naming and many more!'
  - bugfix: Ventriloquist forced speech fixed for special characthers
  - bugfix: Fixed the apply damage smite
