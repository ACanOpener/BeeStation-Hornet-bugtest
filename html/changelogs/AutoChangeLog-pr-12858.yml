changes:
  - bugfix: fixes prosthetic surgery not removing the old limb
  - rscadd: adds text output for failing to attach prosthetics
  - code_imp: unit tests various surgeries to prevent regressions
  - refactor: refactors surgery procs to pass args to consider a sterile testing environment
      (we need our code to actually work in a unit test)
  - bugfix: cleans up 'repeating' surgeries. Surgeries will try to repeat as a default
      behavior if they fail at first (like using a kitchen knife as a scalpel for
      tend wounds)
