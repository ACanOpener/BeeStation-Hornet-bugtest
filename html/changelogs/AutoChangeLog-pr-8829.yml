changes:
  - code_imp: improved language codes
  - rscadd: added Metalanguage - everyone can understand this, but only speakable
      by specific situation. (mentor rat can say this. curator can't say this). You
      know this language, but it will not be visible in your known language list.
  - imageadd: lang icon for metalanguage
  - tweak: Gibbering language icon will not be visible to yourself any longer. No
      meta yourself that your language is broken.
  - tweak: some mobs (especially animals) will now say in Metalanguage instead of
      Common. Rats will squeak, cats will meow, but not in Galactic Common.
