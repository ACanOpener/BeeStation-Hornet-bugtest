changes:
  - balance: The hand teleporter can now lock onto slipspace wakes left behind by
      bluespace, cult and magic teleportations.
  - balance: Portals closed by the hand teleporter take 3 seconds to be dispeled.
      Portals will have an animation upon expiring rather than instantly disappearing.
  - bugfix: The hand teleporter will no longer open entry portals inside windows and
      airlocks
