changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed some heretic spells restarting the cooldown even though they failed
      (cleave, blood siphon, mansus link, nightwatcher's rebirth)
  - bugfix: Fixed Nightwatcher's Rebirth causing toxin damage to oozeling users, when
      it should be healing them of toxin damage.
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime error when accidentally using Blood Siphon on a non-living
      target.
