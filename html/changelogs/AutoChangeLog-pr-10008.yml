changes:
  - rscadd: Mosin Obrez! Sawn-off Mosin Nagant; has innate & wild spread, kicks like
      a mule, and can be fired 1-handed
  - tweak: Any saw type item (and plasmacutters) can be used to saw guns short
  - tweak: Energy saws can be used as saws now (similar to chainsaws)
  - tweak: You cannot add multiple slings to an improvised shotgun, and it shows on
      examine text now
  - balance: Mosin Nagant and Obrez require 2-hands to cycle the bolt (up from 1-hand)
  - imageadd: Added icon and in-hand sprites for Mosin Obrez
  - refactor: removed redundant sawoff code for shotguns, now part of the parent gun/ballistic
      item
  - code_imp: rewrites some boltaction code to make it less weird for item interactions/attaching
      bayonets
  - code_imp: sawing checks for TOOL_SAW instead of using bespoke items, is an innate
      ballistic gun function, and is more configurable.
