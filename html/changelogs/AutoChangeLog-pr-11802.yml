changes:
  - tweak: limbs are now disabled upon taking 40 damage instead of 50.
  - balance: This means stamina weapons can be strategically used to disable limbs
      without chest-aimed full stamcrit always being the better option.
  - balance: This also means it is somewhat easier for sharp weapons to de-limb.
