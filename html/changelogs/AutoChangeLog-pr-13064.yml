changes:
  - tweak: Autotransfer will now trigger automatically once a certain amount of time
      has passed again even with no votes due to players heckling others for using
      the system as intended.
  - tweak: Dead players an antagonists are no longer factored into the calculation
      for how many votes are required to leave. If the number of living non-antagonist
      crew is dwindling, votes to begin a new round should be given a heavier weight
      to offset total antagonist takeover situations.
