changes:
  - tweak: Vent crawling now has a 1% chance every 3 seconds of constant movement
      of giving notice to everyone nearby that can hear it, meaning once per 5 minutes
      of vent crawling does it play a sound to hearing mobs.
  - balance: Closed/broken/offline atmospherics machinery now prevents creatures from
      vent-crawling through them, though vents/scrubbers remain unchanged and require
      being welded still.
