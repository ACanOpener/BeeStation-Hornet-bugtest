changes:
  - balance: Reworks energy shields to be based on integrity rather than charges.
  - balance: Shielded syndicate hardsuits will now protect against 60 total damage
      rather than 3 attacks. It regenerates 10 health per second after 20 seconds
      of not being attacked.
  - balance: The battlemage suit will grant 300 damage protection, without the ability
      to recharge the shield over time. Each battlemage shield charge will provide
      400 shield health.
  - balance: Cult shielded hardsuits will protect against 100 damage before permanently
      breaking, but will not defend against melee attacks.
