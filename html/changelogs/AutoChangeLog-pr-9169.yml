changes:
  - balance: Armour now stacks compoundly rather than additively. 2 sets of 50% armour
      will result in a total armour rating of 75% rather than 100%.
  - refactor: Refactors the code for armour penetration.
  - balance: Armour now has a maximum of 75% protection when coming from combat sources
      (Radsuits won't be capped at 75% protection).
  - balance: When the amount of armour a player has exceeds 50, additional armour
      will increase the armour however it will have a diminishing returns effect.
      This maps [50, Infinity] -> [50, 75] in a way such that adding more armour is
      always better for you and is guaranteed to result in an improved defense, but
      having infinite armour will only give you a total protection rating of 75%.
