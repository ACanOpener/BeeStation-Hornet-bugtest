delete-after: true
changes:
  - rscadd: Gateway teleportation to the Lavaland base and vice-versa, through the
      old refinery room. You can teleport people, mobs (except megafauna and ashwalkers),
      goods and supplies through.
  - rscadd: Gateway access to miners and the QM, with access to cargo techs on skeleton
      crew.
  - balance: The Gateway needs to be activated on BOTH SIDES to work, so someone still
      needs to go down there and turn it on, and it can be turned off from either
      side as well.
  - balance: Swarmers now need the (station-side) gateway to be on in order to spawn!
  - rscadd: To compensate, access requirements have been loosened on the lavaland
      base to mimic station access.
  - rscdel: All other usages of the gateway (Ruins and random maints).
  - rscdel: Swarmers fabricator (unused)
