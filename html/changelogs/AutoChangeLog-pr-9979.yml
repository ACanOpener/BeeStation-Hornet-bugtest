changes:
  - tweak: Damaging zombie tumors deal brain damage instead of toxin damage.
  - tweak: Hostile zombies now heal brain damage over time as well, and fully heal
      brain damage upon conversion
  - tweak: Brain damage progresses twice as fast as toxin damage so patients die sooner
      (this is done because brain damage cannot cause crit)
  - tweak: The delay between death and resurrection as a zombie has been increased
      by 50% to make up for the lack of time spent in crit.
