changes:
  - balance: Maltodextrin's overall power has been substantially reduced. When fully
      processed, maltodextrin will leave you with about the same hunger you had before
      eating junk food instead of substantially hungrier than you were before eating.
  - tweak: Maltodextrin's effect is now gradual instead of instantaneous and players
      should no longer experience sudden, crippling starvation as a result.
  - tweak: The amount of maltodextrin in junk foods has been adjusted in accordance
      with the above changes.
