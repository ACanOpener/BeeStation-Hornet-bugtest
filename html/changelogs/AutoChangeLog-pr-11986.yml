changes:
  - bugfix: The Chat Highlights chat settings work again.
  - bugfix: Readded the High Contrast chat toggle, which was accidentally removed,
      although still functioning (you just couldn't change it)
  - bugfix: Readded the Stat Tab Mode setting, albeit just under "General" settings
      rather than its own "Stat Tab" area.
