changes:
  - bugfix: you can freely exit your corpse with your WASD keys again, even if you
      die in lava
  - refactor: cleaned up movement_delay
  - balance: Consequently, carbon movement will no longer be interrupted or delayed
      by an initial attack. While a longtime feature, this is actually the result
      of a bug. This will lower an already strong advantage an aggressor usually has
      in a combat situation, and should even the playing field. Slowdown due to overall
      damage to the carbon is not affected.
