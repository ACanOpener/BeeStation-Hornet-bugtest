changes:
  - bugfix: Vehicles coded to require hands now actually require functional and empty
      hands to operate. Most vehicles require hands, but skateboards, motorized wheelchairs
      and Wheely Heelies do not.
  - bugfix: Vehicles no longer have multiple riding elements applied to them, which
      would cause very haywire things to happen.
  - tweak: Motorized wheelchairs actually did require hands, this requirement has
      been removed because they are propelled by a motor rather than by hand.
