changes:
  - balance: Wheelys now have the same speed as skateboards instead of lightspeed.
  - balance: Nitrium move speed buff has been reduced. High and low doses provide
      different boosts now as well, but both are lower than the old speed.
  - balance: Nitrium is no longer fatal in any capacity when misused, making it the
      safest available speed boosting "drug".
  - balance: Nitrium no longer gives damage slowdown immunity, but has retained all
      other immunities.
  - tweak: Nitrium stops restoring stamina after a certain point, and instead starts
      to inflict stamina damage. This is indicated by the messages "Your body aches!"
      or "Your body feels like it's on fire!" when you are under the effects. (Note
      that nitrium still offers stamina crit immunity so you will never accidentally
      fall into stamcrit making you unable to switch your internals off)
  - tweak: Nitrium is now highly addicting and has an overdose threshold. These do
      not mechanically punish players and serve only as flavor and a clear warning
      respectively.
