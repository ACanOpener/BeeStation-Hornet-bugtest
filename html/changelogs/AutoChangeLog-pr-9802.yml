changes:
  - code_imp: cleaned up buckling checks, reducing edge cases. Documents buckling
      code.
  - balance: removes snowflake code for cyborg buckling. Cyborgs can instantly buckle
      people on the same tile as them(like obj buckling), but now have the same time
      to buckle people to things as any other buckling object if buckled from an adjacent
      tile
