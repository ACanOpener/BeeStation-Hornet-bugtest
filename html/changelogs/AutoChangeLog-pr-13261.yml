changes:
  - rscadd: Added new solar panel sprites. These dynamically track the sun instead
      of being fixed to incremental angles
  - rscadd: 'Solar panels can now be upgraded based on what glass they are made of,
      the higher tier the glass is, the higher the multiplier is. The tiers are as
      follows: normal glass - 1x, titanium glass - 2x, plasma glass - 3x, plastitanium
      glass - x4'
  - rscdel: Removed the goonstation folder
  - refactor: Refactored SSsun and solar panel code.
