changes:
  - refactor: Rewrote multiz rendering to use Z-Mimic. Should vastly reduce lag caused
      by multiz rendering. Some things may not render properly.
  - bugfix: Emissives will no longer leak onto the z-level above.
  - rscadd: Added multiz lighting. Nonmovable lights will now bleed up and down.
