changes:
  - rscadd: WHO THE HELL LET THE ANTS OUT?! Adds ant & mold reagents. Ants act like
      caltrops when thrown on the floor.
  - rscadd: Food Decomposition! Leaving certain foodtypes out or on the ground will
      make them start to decompose! This will attract mold and bugs. This may look
      like it makes your food unedible to most, but it may make it even more appetizing
      to some...
  - rscadd: Giant Ants.
  - rscadd: more sharp things act as caltrops
  - rscadd: adds a few rotten/moldy food variants
  - rscadd: Bugs foodtype. Lizards like it. Moths taste like it.
