changes:
  - tweak: The job assignment algorithm has been changed to prioritise statistical
      randomness for players with many job roles enabled, over ensuring that head
      and security positions are filled. Selecting all jobs to medium ensures that
      you have the same probability of rolling any job, while setting all jobs to
      low means that you will get the jobs which other players did not select.
  - tweak: If the round starts with less than 7 players online, then all but the captain,
      shaft miner and basic department jobs will be disabled and these roles will
      be given access to their entire department.
  - tweak: If the roundstarts with less than 14 players online, some non-important
      job roles will be disabled.
  - tweak: Skeleton crew access is now based on job presence rather than population.
  - tweak: There are now unlimited job slots for medical doctors, security officers,
      engineerings, cargo technicians and scientists but for these slots to be open
      requires there to be at most a difference of 2 between the most and least populated
      of these jobs.
