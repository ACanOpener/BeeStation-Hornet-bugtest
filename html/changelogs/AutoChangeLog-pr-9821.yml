changes:
  - bugfix: 'You can now use keybinds bound to common AZERTY keys such as: & é " (
      è _ ç à ) ² $ ù : * !'
  - bugfix: Keys will no longer get stuck down when using key combinations like Alt,
      Shift, and Ctrl.
  - tweak: Improved the error message when preferences/keybinds fail to fetch client
      data, stating that reconnecting will likely fix it.
