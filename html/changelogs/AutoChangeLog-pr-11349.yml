changes:
  - tweak: Mechs now fling their occupants in a random direction upon destruction,
      including when a mech falls down a chasm.
  - code_imp: Mechs now have an Eject() proc that can be called directly without destroying
      the mech.
  - bugfix: Mechs can no longer continue walking around when falling into a chasm
  - tweak: Mechs no longer put pilots to sleep when breaking, instead stunning the
      pilot and knocking them down for a time dependant on the type of mech.
