changes:
  - rscdel: Removed the grand majority of the Goon icon
  - soundadd: Replaced some sounds with non-goon variants
  - imageadd: added new icons for the marijuana, gym equipement, dish driver and vault
      terminal
  - refactor: Gym equipment was reworked. You now buckle yourself to weight machines
      to use them, rather than clicking on it and getting stunned for a few seconds.
      It also means it works like a chair now.
  - tweak: Gym equipment no longer breaks a sweat in no gravity.
