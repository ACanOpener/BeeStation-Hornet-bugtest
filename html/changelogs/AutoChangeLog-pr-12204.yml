changes:
  - refactor: Converted TGUI backend from Inferno to React. Minimal user-facing changes.
  - code_imp: Added backend TGUI support for 516 (Webview2/Chromium support). This
      means that our TGUI is now potentially compatible with OpenDream as well.
  - code_imp: Ended support for IE8 (commonly used by Linux machines), since it never
      worked anyway. RIP.
  - code_imp: Various dropdowns will now prioritize their display text over the "selected"
      field. Added displayTextFirst flag to Dropdowns.
  - code_imp: The Orbital Map no longer uses document APIs to find the current object
      ref.
  - code_imp: Removed many, many instances of keyCode and replaced them with key
  - code_imp: Refactored NumberInput component to Typescript, removing various extraneous
      properties
