changes:
  - bugfix: Service borg glasses and graspers are no longer covered in industrial
      glue and can actually be used to serve drinks again
  - tweak: Service and Medical cyborgs can now synthesize standard, 50u drinking glasses
      and beakers respectively with their graspers. Simply use their grasping tool
      with nothing in it to produce one.
  - tweak: Medical and service cyborgs can both hold a much wider variety of reagent
      containers now
  - tweak: Service cyborgs can now synthesize a wider variety of drinks instead of
      being primarily focused on alcoholic beverages.
