changes:
  - rscadd: Made the viral extrapolator output look much better.
  - rscadd: Added some additional info to the viral extrapolator's examine - telling
      the user the maximum stealth / level it can extract, and how long extractions
      take.
  - rscadd: The viral extrapolator will now tell you when scanning if it has extracted
      that same virus previously.
  - tweak: You no longer have to click on an exact sprite to scan or extract a virus
      from something with the viral extrapolator - if you click on something that
      doesn't have any valid diseases (such as a floor tile), you will instead scan/extract
      whatever thing on that tile that does have a valid disease. (And if there's
      multiple things on the tile, you can choose which one to scan from a popup)
  - tweak: Extracting a virus from someone now displays a visible message, rather
      than being completely silent except for the beep afterwards.
  - rscadd: Vector (the virologist's pet hamster) is always guaranteed to have at
      least one level 9 symptom in its freebie virus.
  - rscadd: Morgue corpses and roundstart monkeys can also generate with dormant diseases
      now, although they can be less reliable and more of a wildcard than diseases
      in dried blood/vomit/gibs or crew members.
  - bugfix: Fixed only being able to extract symptoms rather than full diseases from
      rats.
  - bugfix: Morgue corpses now have a small chance to be a non-human (and non-IPC)
      roundstart race.
  - refactor: Refactored how `extrapolator_act` works.
