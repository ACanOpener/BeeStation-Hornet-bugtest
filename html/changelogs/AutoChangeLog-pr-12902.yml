changes:
  - balance: Motorized wheelchair speed has been rebalanced, they can go up to normal
      run speed at t3 parts without risk of crashing, and can go even faster than
      regular humans if T4 parts are used and the safeties are overridden with a multitool,
      at the risk (or bonus, if you see it that way) of crashing violently if they
      bump into anything.
  - tweak: Examining motorized wheelchairs gives a more accurate view of their speed,
      power consumption and shows what tools can be used on them.
  - tweak: Motorized wheelchairs consume less power with T1 parts, but consume slightly
      more than before at T4.
  - bugfix: Motorized wheelchairs consume the correct amount of power when moving,
      and no longer consume power when dragged, along with no longer causing countless
      runtimes when dragged around without a cell. They also no longer spam the chat
      when they are missing a power cell or are simply out of charge.
  - bugfix: Motorized wheelchairs spawned on maps or by admins are now fully functional,
      albeit with only T1 parts.
