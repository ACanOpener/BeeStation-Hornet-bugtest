changes:
  - rscdel: Removed Joules
  - tweak: Power now always only shows up to 1 decimal to simplify reading.
  - code_imp: Reworks Power measures
  - tweak: Reworks Power Cell charges and other calculations
  - tweak: Inducers and Cell Chargers now depend on cell recharge rates for their
      calculation
  - bugfix: Fixed Inducer / Cell charge power duplication exploit
  - rscadd: Energy weapons now display remaining shots to depletion on their examine.
  - bugfix: Modular Computers will now drain the proper power depending on if they
      are shut down or enabled.
  - bugfix: Modular Computers now display power drain accurately
  - refactor: Refactored Cell Charger code to be more accurate and avoid dupes.
  - refactor: Refactored power usage updates on some machinery solving duplicated
      power draws
  - balance: Rebalanced some power usage costs for machinery
  - tweak: SMES's now take matter bins instead of cells and display TOTAL POWER
  - refactor: Changed how SMES's calculate total power and other boring things
  - tweak: APCs now display total power
  - refactor: Refactored APC code regarding power. APCs are fasted, more accurate
      in their calculations and don't freeze randomly. Also they now display sound,
      text and overlays that were intended but were poorly coded so never seen.
  - refactor: Refactored Recharger code.
  - bugfix: Fixed lights drawing power twice
  - balance: Rebalances costs for power consumption of most machinery to ensure lights
      aren't the only things drawing any noticeable power.
  - code_imp: Fixed some instances where machines weren't using the right proc to
      discern if they're in IDLE or ACTIVE power consumption modes.
  - refactor: Refactored emitter code so they have less of a mind of their own and
      actually fire if there is enough power.
  - rscadd: Added a special power draw mechanic to the gravity generator (Since it
      had no power cost to begin with). If it's either powering up or powering down
      it's power use will be 10 times higher than when it is stable.
