changes:
  - rscadd: Added bloom, an effect that adds a 'whiteout' around bright light sources,
      making rooms appear bright overall and have more texture.
  - rscadd: Added "Bloom Level" preference under Graphics, defaulting at 50%.
  - tweak: Slightly reduced the lighting power of APCs, as they were causing too much
      bloom.
  - code_imp: Removed some unused lighting code.
