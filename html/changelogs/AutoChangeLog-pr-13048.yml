changes:
  - tweak: Poisoned knife costs 4 TC in uplinks now, down from 6.
  - balance: Poisoned knife now has the same damage and embedding chance as a combat
      knife (20 damage and 65% respectively)
  - rscadd: Poisoned knives inject their entire remaining payload if they embed successfully,
      up to 40u. High reward rule of cool payoff for those that want to gamble on
      a 65% chance.
  - tweak: Poisoned knife now delivers 1/3 of its intended payload to targets that
      are protected from injection (Previously this was 1u regardless of intended
      injection amount)
