changes:
  - tweak: Xenomorph hunter leap attack now does 110 stamina damage instead of being
      hardcoded as a 10 second stun. This means armor will potentially mitigate this
      to less than an immediate takedown
  - tweak: All xenomorphs now do slightly more stamina damage with right click attack
  - bugfix: Xenomorph acid no longer instantly annihilates mobs, but has had its cost
      reduced to 50. This ability was not previously intended to work on mobs at all,
      so consider this turning a bug into a feature officially.
  - bugfix: Removed an armor check from acid_processing() proc which was both unnecessary
      and causing runtimes due to bad args
