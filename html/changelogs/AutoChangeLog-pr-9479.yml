changes:
  - tweak: The SM now has a max positive gas composition accumulation of 5% per tick.
      This should reduce SM instability, but from testing it does not appear to fix
      the notorious "SM delam bug".
  - bugfix: The SM's power will not update when it is not supposed to.
  - bugfix: Fixed double parsing of gas strings.
