changes:
  - rscadd: Adds a new type of reagent, metabolites. Metabolites are produced as a
      byproduct of any reagent with a metabolite set and can be used to trace what
      kinds of reagents someone has been exposed to at least somewhat recently. For
      now metabolites are only implemented for Bicaridine, Kelotane, Antitoxin, Tricordrazine,
      Styptic Powder and Silver Sulfadiazine.
  - balance: Bicaridine, Kelotane, Antitoxin and Tricordrazine are equally effective
      regardless of current HP again, instead having their effects wane as metabolites
      build up. They will always be useful, but will never be the only thing you need
      to treat more severe injuries.
  - tweak: Bruise packs and ointment now utilize reagent code to heal instead of directly
      healing. Due to overdosing concerns, they heal for half as much per application,
      but come with twice as many applications per stack to compensate.
  - balance: Because they now properly utilize medicine, ointments and bruise packs
      are now very painful! Players will find they are unable to subject themselves
      to this pain if they try to apply more than one in quick succession. Seek help
      from others if you need multiple applications!
  - tweak: Gauze can now heal injured simplemobs just like bruise packs.
