changes:
  - balance: All explorer assassination targets now spawn with a few medical supplies
      and a flashlight to help them deal with potential mobs nearby
  - balance: The operative assassination target now spawns with a combat knife so
      that they have a moderately powerful melee option if they run out of ammo for
      the stechkin
  - balance: The spy assassination target now spawns with a stechkin, suppressor,
      spy glasses kit, and chameleon mask for voice changing. They do not have a second
      clip for their gun.
  - balance: The clown assassination target now spawns with a lube flower instead
      of water flower, and also knows taeclowndo thanks to their fancy shoes.
