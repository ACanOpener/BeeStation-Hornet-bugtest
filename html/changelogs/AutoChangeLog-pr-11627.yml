changes:
  - tweak: felinid fall immunity is now stored on the cat tail. If you have a cat
      tail, you have felinid fall immunity.
  - balance: strips out felinid flat fall damage reduction. Having a cat tail will
      only give you the single level immunity. Any fall greater than 1 level, you
      share the same damage as the rest of the humanoids.
  - tweak: Consuming chocolate as a catperson will now only deal a flat amount of
      damage to your stomach. It is no longer possible to get brain damage from your
      tummyache.
