changes:
  - tweak: Cryptographic Sequencers (Emags) no longer cause permanent damage to airlocks.
      They will still bolt doors open and cause them to completely lose power indefinitely
      (which means no silicon access). Pulse or cut/repair power wires to fix emagged
      doors.
  - tweak: Removes the smoking panel message from airlocks that have been emagged,
      since they are no longer permanently damaged
  - tweak: Pulsing power wires now resets the time before power comes back on.
