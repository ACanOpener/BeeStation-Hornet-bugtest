changes:
  - bugfix: coffins are not mistaken for normal crates when sold
  - bugfix: coffins and ore boxes are now subject to demand elasticity, and don't
      mention the Crates Recycling Program when sold
  - tweak: The time to build a coffin is now 5 seconds
  - balance: The selling prices of ore boxes, coffins and wooden crates have been
      tweaked to give a reasonable profit when sold
