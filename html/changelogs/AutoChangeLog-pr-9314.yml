changes:
  - refactor: machine components are now stored inside the machines themselves, instead
      of sent to a magical nullspace and creating errors
  - rscadd: As a result of making circuitboards components, you can now do things
      like place a bomb on circuitboard, build it in a machine, and it will blow up
      like you expect it to!
  - bugfix: machines no longer vend their own components accidentally
  - bugfix: machines that are supposed to eject contents should actually do so more,
      and those that shouldn't, should do so less
