changes:
  - balance: Chapel, Law office, virology, morgue, chemistry, genetics, cargo bay
      and tech storage will now have their airlock shock wires labelled.
  - balance: Electricuted airlocks will no longer shock people with the UI open, only
      when performing a pulse action or using a multitool on the door for the first
      time. This means that low tier airlocks are now safe to hack.
  - balance: Airlocks now have an indication when they are shocked (Test light is
      bright and flickering).
