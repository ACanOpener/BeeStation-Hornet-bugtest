changes:
  - rscadd: converted meat, monkeycubes to newfood
  - tweak: moved meatbun from Bread recipes to Meat recipes
  - rscadd: Adjusted meatdish & meatslab values to account for protein reagent
  - tweak: converted a few extraneous meats to follow proper subtyping. Dolphin meat
      is now a meatslab instead of snowflake. Carp meat is now a subtype of fishmeat,
      rather than regular fishmeat being a subtype of carp meat
  - bugfix: fixes psyphoza meat using the wrong typepath and stats
