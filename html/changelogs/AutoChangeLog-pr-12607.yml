changes:
  - rscadd: adds atmos reaction lookup system. Rclick on a analyzer or use the atmos
      PDA app to search up gases and how to make them.
  - rscadd: combined stimulum and nitryl into Nitrium.
  - balance: As the nitryl decomposition reaction exists, Nitryl isnt supposed to
      have two drawbacks. Nitryl will no longer cause burns to your body, just lung
      damage.
  - bugfix: fixed gas colors
