changes:
  - rscadd: Added a search bar to the morph stomach UI.
  - rscadd: Morphs can now digest nutritious food to recover small amounts of health,
      however this healing is capped - a morph can only recover up to 20% of its health
      over the course of 2.5 minutes by digesting food.
  - tweak: Being husked by morph digestion is now considered a burn husk, meaning
      that synthflesh or rezadone can fix morph digestion victims.
